## 📖 Overview

Adaptive Graph Transformer is a deep learning framework that combines the expressive power of Transformer architectures with graph structural information.

Unlike traditional Graph Neural Networks that rely solely on local message passing, this model leverages **adaptive self-attention mechanisms** to capture both:

- 🌐 Long-range node dependencies
- 🔗 Local graph structure
- 📊 Rich node and edge features
- ⚡ Global graph context

This enables more effective representation learning for tasks such as:

- Node Classification
- Graph Classification
- Link Prediction
- Recommendation Systems
- Knowledge Graph Analysis
- Social Network Modeling

Graph Transformers have emerged as a powerful alternative to conventional GNNs by incorporating attention-based learning on graph-structured data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
